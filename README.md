Basic Python experiments that can be used in VS code, or really any IDE that supports Python environments.
Just copy the code, or clone the repo, paste it into your IDEs editor and then generate a new Python REPL, To do this just use CTRL + SHFT + `, or CMD + SHFT + `.
Then, save the code in your editor with CTRL + S and run the code.
IMPORTANT NOTE.... Make sure to also make a new folder on your device and give it a name so VS code has a file to pull in and then save the data to.
