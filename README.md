# Python Experiments

Basic Python experiments that can be used in VS Code, or really any IDE that supports Python environments.

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the code in your IDE (VS Code recommended)
3. Generate a new Python REPL: `CTRL + SHIFT + \`` (Windows/Linux) or `CMD + SHIFT + \`` (Mac)
4. Save the code with `CTRL + S` (or `CMD + S` on Mac) and run it
5. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Create a new folder on your device and give it a name so VS Code has a proper workspace to save data

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the **[Docs](Docs/)** directory:

- **[Getting Started](Docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**: Quick start guide for beginners
- **[Setup Instructions](Docs/SETUP.md)**: Detailed setup guide for Python and VS Code
- **[Calculator Guide](Docs/CALCULATOR.md)**: Documentation for the calculator application

### Copy Docs to Your Desktop

You can easily copy the entire documentation folder to your Desktop for offline access:

```bash
python copy_docs_to_desktop.py
```

This script will create a `python-experiments-Docs` folder on your Desktop with all documentation files.

## Available Experiments

- **calculator_up_to_1000.py**: A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on numbers between 0 and 1000
